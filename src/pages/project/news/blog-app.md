As you may have seen, I had already made a blog for part of my graduate work but the goal was not to have a site focused on it.

So I decided to make a new one to continue learning Django.

This time, there can be several users who publish articles and each of them have their presentation page and their linked articles. There is also a search bar to search and display articles by author, by tag or by title.

To develop all this, I used different python modules that were very useful, especially for the management of tags in the database.
