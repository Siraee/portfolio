The extension was part of my graduate work.

It has a simple goal: Notify users when a Twitch livestream is launched on a chosen channel.

The design is quite simple on purpose so that it doesn't take too much space on the screen and it clearly indicates if a livestream is in progress or not. To know if the streamer is live, I retrieved external data with the <a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/" target="_blank">Twitch API</a>.

The streamer's networks are displayed to be redirected directly to his different social networks and to subscribe.
