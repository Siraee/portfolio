**This work was my graduation project.**

The goal of this project was to centralize the content of several social networks in one place and to add new features.

The project includes a home page to present the website and its features, a page that brings together the latest Youtube videos of a channel, a page that highlights a Twitch live as well as its chat in which we can interact with the streamer and his bot.

There is also a page that gathers blog articles, a page where we can vote in polls and finally, a contact page. Some website features are only accessible to people who have authenticated themselves with a Google account.

To develop this project, I used different technologies that allowed me to complete it.

I mainly used the Django framework which is based on Python. With this, I used PostgreSQL for the databases.
I also used Django Template Language which is very similar to Jinja2. 

For front-end interactions, I obviously used Javascript.
And finally, for all the design, I recompiled Bootstrap v5 to adapt it to mine and I added some details in CSS.
