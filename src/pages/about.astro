					That's it, we are finally at the presentation!
First of all, thank you for coming all the way here and being interested in my projects or my background as a developer!
				</p>
				<p>
					Let me introduce myself, my name is Dylan a.k.a. Siraee and I am 25 years old.
I am a young junior developer of Belgian nationality. I like Formula 1 very much and I'm passionate about video games. I also like movies and series as well as mangas! I'm a very passionate, motivated and hardworking person.
				</p>
				<p>
					I discovered my passion for development during my first studies in the same field. It's now been 3 years since I started and I really like what I do every day. I started my studies in September 2019 and finished them in May 2022 with a high distinction on my degree.
				</p>
				<p>
					My first studies were back-end oriented, that's why this year I'm starting to study a bit more front-end oriented to be able to be a fullstack developer.
				</p>
				<p>
					I would like to be able to launch myself as a freelance developer and if possible, to collaborate with friends who are in the same field.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want to contact me, you can do it on {' '} <a href="https://twitter.com/SiraeeDev" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Twitter</a> or {' '} <a href="https://github.com/Siraee" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Github</a>. I speak French and English.
